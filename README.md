# Kakuro

This project is a solver for Kakuro puzzles. Kakuro is a mathematical puzzle game in which columns and rows need to add
up to given sums. Only the digits 1-9 are eligible and no row or column may repeat a digit.

In the future, I could foresee AR scanning making the input *significantly* speedier, because inputting board
information by hand is both tedious and impractical. Given an AR input scanner, my solver should be robust enough to
handle puzzles of any size at very fast speeds.

This repository is written completely in Java, so there could be room for computational energy optimization, but the OOP
Java offers was too difficult to pass up when building this project.
